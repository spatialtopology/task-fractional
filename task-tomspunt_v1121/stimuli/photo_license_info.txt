The stock photographs used to create the stimuli were purchased from an online stock photography database. The purchase of each photograph provides a license that allows both its use in the task, and its not-for-profit distribution to scientists who plan to use the task in a not-for-profit fashion. Further details regarding photo licensing can be acquired by contacting Dr. Robert Spunt at bobspunt@gmail.com
